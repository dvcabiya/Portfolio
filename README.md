# vcabiya.com, My Portfolio Website.

### About:
This site is meant to be a concise overview of who I am, what I do, and my projects. If a web-based project isn't important enough to have it's own domain, it'll probably be hosted here. At present, I am in college and hosting websites costs money, so the quality and size of this site will hopefully only increase over time.
